  # Options:
  #   - allkeys-lru: Evict any key using LRU (good for cache)
  #   - volatile-lru: Evict keys with TTL using LRU
  #   - allkeys-lfu: Evict any key using LFU (least frequently used)
  #   - volatile-lfu: Evict keys with TTL using LFU
  #   - allkeys-random: Evict random keys
  #   - volatile-random: Evict random keys with TTL
  #   - volatile-ttl: Evict keys with shortest TTL
  #   - noeviction: Return errors when memory limit is reached
